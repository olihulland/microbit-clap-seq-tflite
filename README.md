# Clap Sequence Recogniser for MicroBit using Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers

## How to use (skip first 2 steps if model.h already exists)

1. Model is created by running the `tensorflow_model.py` script in `model_maker/`. This uses `data.csv` to generate a 
neural network model and converts it to the correct format for tensorflow lite for microcontrollers.
2. Copy the `model_maker/model_tflite_micro.h` file generated by the python script into `source/` and rename it to `model.h`.
3. Build using `/build.py`.
